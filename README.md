# UCMCTrack

> **[AAAI 2024] UCMCTrack: Multi-Object Tracking with Uniform Camera Motion Compensation**.
> UCMCTrack is a simple pure motion based tracker that achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets. In particular, **it achieves the first place on MOT17 without using any appearance cues**, making it highly applicable for real-time object tracking on end devices.


#### Environment
Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:
- Python (3.8 or later)
- PyTorch with CUDA support
- Ultralytics Library
- Download weight file [yolov10m.pt](https://github.com/jameslahm/yolov10/releases/download/v1.0/yolov10m.pt to folder `pretrained`
- The current task is working good with yolov10m.pt. however you may use other variants too.
#### Run the demo

```bash
python demo.py --video Input_videos/vid_4.mp4
python demo.py --video Input_videos/vid_6.mp4
python demo.py --video Input_videos/vid_14.mp4
```
-The output video, along with the detection, tracking, and crash JSON files, will be saved in the output/ folder
## üóº Pipeline of UCMCTrack
First, the detection boxes are mapped onto the ground plane using homography transformation. Subsequently, the Correlated Measurement Distribution (CMD) of the target is computed. This distribution is then fed into a Kalman filter equipped with the Constant Velocity (CV) motion model and Process Noise Compensation (PNC). Next, the mapped measurement and the predicted track state are utilized as inputs to compute the Mapped Mahalanobis Distance (MMD). Finally, the Hungarian algorithm is applied to associate the mapped measurements with tracklets, thereby obtaining complete tracklets.
